🪷 LOKA - Reclaiming Culture Through Technology
"How can we capture culture, connect people, and preserve it effectively?"

📌 Situation
Indonesia is one of the most culturally rich nations in the world:

1,300+ ethnic groups

700+ regional languages

676 total elements listed in UNESCO’s Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH) registry

Yet, only 16 of those come from Indonesia.

Urbanization is accelerating:

59% of Indonesians now live in cities, weakening ties with rural heritage

Cultural practices are fading as younger generations disconnect from their roots

⚠️ Issues
Cultural knowledge is fragmented and underrepresented, especially in digital platforms

Lack of incentives for people to share and preserve local traditions

AI and tech adoption in the cultural preservation space is minimal

Limited recognition for cultural contributors and storytellers
